     The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has dropped
   to zero.  It must update next_out and avail_out when avail_out has dropped
   to zero.  The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and opaque before
   calling the init function.  All other fields are set by the compression
   library and must not be updated by the application.

     The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of zalloc and zfree.  This can be useful for custom
   memory management.  The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

     zalloc must return 0 if there is not enough memory for the object.
   If zlib is used in a multi-threaded application, zalloc and zfree must be
   thread safe.

     On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this if
   the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.hpp).  To reduce memory requirements
   and avoid any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of compression ratio,
   compile the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.hpp).

     The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or progress
   reports.  After compression, total_in holds the total size of the
   uncompressed data and may be saved for use in the decompressor (particularly
   if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in a single step).
